# scala-atom
From Atomic Scala book

There is no atom number 013 due to in the books it is about the Scala documentation.

### UPDATE

From now on I am doing this using this great tool https://scalafiddle.io so I will be adding links to the exercises from Abstract Class atom to the end of the book.

- Abstract Classes https://scalafiddle.io/sf/dxImXo8/2
